# Claude Requested Text - WikiJS Migration Project

## All User Requests in Chronological Order

### Request 1 - July 28, 2025 - 12:59:00
Read @README.md so you are up to date. I need to improve the data output when extracting info from the XML file and created the MD output files. Can you search the web if there are is more info about the "Confluence entities.xml structure" ? I just run the command "./extract_confluence_pages.sh confluence-example-nmella-space/entities.xml" which generated the example output file @confluence_pages/Example_Page_2981298295.md I need the MD output to be more like this @example-template-output.md ? Can you improve the script so the MD files outputs can have the structure and layout similar to the @example-template-output.md ? Also, use the ID for the page name, so instead of "Example_Page_2981298295.md" it should be named "2981298295.md".

### Request 2 - July 28, 2025 - 14:05:00
The code section is not working. After I execute the script on file @confluence-example-nmella-space/entities.xml the result page at @confluence_pages/2981298295.md:23 shows empty code section at lines 23-25, but if you chech the entities.xml file on lines 2603 and 2604 it shows this code "<php>
test 
</php"

### Request 3 - July 28, 2025 - 14:08:08
On purpose I remove the closing tag ">" at the end... because we don't need to validate or review the code section, just parse whatever it is inside ...

### Request 4 - July 28, 2025 - 14:14:02
It is possible to create each *.md page with the confluence path route ? For example, the page ID 2981298295.md should be created with the directory structure "/wiki/spaces/~712020ba8bc34ba4984fd782ae367b4b95f788/2981298295.md"

### Request 5 - July 28, 2025 - 14:21:14
Why the attachments at @confluence-example-nmella-space/attachments/ were not moved to the @confluence_pages_paths ? (So the image links actually works...for example: /wiki/spaces/~712020ba8bc34ba4984fd782ae367b4b95f788/pages/2981298295/attachments/3030712333/1 won't work if the image is not moved)

### Request 6 - July 28, 2025 - 14:24:56
Please stop creating new scripts files...just edit the actual @extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh

### Request 7 - July 28, 2025 - 14:29:40
The quote section is not being output as expected. For example, on @confluence-example-nmella-space/entities.xml:2605 it the quote text: "quote text example". In the output file @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~712020ba8bc34ba4984fd782ae367b4b95f788/pages/2981298295.md it shows "> 

quote text example" but the expected output should be "> quote text example"

### Request 8 - July 28, 2025 - 17:22:11
Can you check attachments ? Files are not copy/move. I executed './extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh confluence-example-nmella-space/entities.xml' but attachments were not save. Also, please save the attachment with its name, so for example, this sample attachment name "1" @confluence-example-nmella-space/attachments/2981298295/3030712333/1 should be rename to "2025-06-03_09-24.png". Also, image attachment location on the generated file @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~712020ba8bc34ba4984fd782ae367b4b95f788/pages/2981298295.md:29 shows "not found"... We should save the image attachment on the relative path '/attachments/2981298295/3030712333/'... so final image should be created as '![2025-06-03_09-24.png](/attachments/2981298295/3030712333/2025-06-03_09-24.png)'

### Request 9 - July 28, 2025 - 17:31:10
Where it says "Below this text, is an image:" at @confluence-example-nmella-space/entities.xml:2605 there should be a line break after the text.

### Request 10 - July 28, 2025 - 17:40:45
If you check line 2605 on file @confluence-example-nmella-space/entities.xml, the image section within the table shows 'ac:custom-width="true" ac:alt="2025-06-03_09-24.png" ac:width="182"' which means that the image was resize to a width of 182px. In the output markdown format, we can do the same by placing the text '=182x' before the closing bracket ')'. So, instead of output '![2025-06-03_09-24.png](/attachments/2981298295/3030712333/2025-06-03_09-24.png)' it should be '![2025-06-03_09-24.png](/attachments/2981298295/3030712333/2025-06-03_09-24.png =182x)'

### Request 11 - July 28, 2025 - 18:03:39
Ok, two more improvements. (1) on line 70932 of file @confluence-karen-sample/entities.xml it shows '<a href="mailto:ivan.navarrete@cic.cl">@Ivan Navarrete</a>'. We should keep this reference text in the markdown output (currently it does not parse it). (2) On line 70956 of the same file, it shows '<ac:task-status>incomplete</ac:task-status>
<ac:task-body><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">' which represents a task line. According to wikijs markdown formating (https://docs.requarks.io/en/editors/markdown#task-lists), we should use task list syntax as: '- [ ]' or '- [x]'.

### Request 12 - July 28, 2025 - 18:11:30
There is a table format error. For example, the first row of this table output as:
"**Cambio Estado Ripley**

[](http://192.168.2.20:1880/#flow/7d8b44b1.f86a0c)[](http://192.168.2.20:1880/#flow/698603f0.709c4c)| **Tecnolog�a** | **Ubicaci�n** | **Funcionalidad** | **Tiempo** | **Estado actual** |" But the expected format should be:

"**Cambio Estado Ripley**

| **Tecnolog�a** | **Ubicaci�n** | **Funcionalidad** | **Tiempo** | **Estado actual** |"

### Request 13 - July 28, 2025 - 18:48:22
There is missing text in the output file  @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2692251698.md .After text 'Clasificaci�n inicial de los pedidos' it should come text '1. Identificar el tipo de l�nea del pedido' but instead it just output '1.'. Please check.

### Request 14 - July 28, 2025 - 18:51:43
Did you read the @.CLAUDE.md ? output files are just examples...no need to edit. You need to fix the script at @extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh

### Request 15 - July 28, 2025 - 20:03:16
On this *.md page output @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/3031040007.md when extracted from @confluence-karen-sample/entities.xml:63762  the number list is always showing the first number ('1.'), so list is like  '1. xxx', '1. yyyy', '1. zzzz'. Instead, it should be '1. xxx', '2. yyyy' and '3. zzzz'. Can you check the @extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh script ? Checking the entities.xml file on line 63762, it clearly shows each number list with '<ol start="1">' or '<ol start="2">'.

### Request 16 - July 28, 2025 - 20:14:43
On output file @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2984443905.md it shows links like: '[https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/1497497604/pages/edit-v2/2985787393/](https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/1497497604/pages/edit-v2/2985787393/)' but the expected link should be like '[Acuerdo Consultor�a TI Diagn�stico 2025](/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2985787393)'. Can you fix the @extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh accordingly ? @.CLAUDE.md

### Request 17 - July 28, 2025 - 20:45:25
Some links do no retrieve the link name. For example, created page @confluence-pages/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2984443905.md still shows links like : '[https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/1497497604/pages/edit-v2/2984411140/](/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2984411140)' but the expected behaviour is to replace the text for the link name, so it should show as '[Alcance](/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2984411140)'. If you check the page ID: 2984411140 at @confluence-karen-sample/entities.xml:37818 you will find that the title name is 'Alcance'. Please check the script @extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh and fix.

### Request 18 - July 28, 2025 - 21:24:19
Please add the text '{.links-list}' after any link or link list. If actual output is like:
  1. [text](link)
  2. [text2](link2)
  
  It would be better to be like this:
  1. [text](link)
  2. [text2](link2)
  {.links-list}
  
  Also, some links don't have a hypen ("-"), so actual output in some cases is:
  [text](link)
  
  But it should be:
  - [text](link)
  {.links-list}

### Request 19 - July 28, 2025 - 21:42:36
Good work. Now, some text/paragraphs are highlighted as a "info", "note", "error", "warning" and "success". For example, text 'Areas o procesos evaluados durante la etapa de levantiemiento.' has 'ac:name="info"'  class. Or text 'No existe el proceso de ruteo u ordenamiento para la ruta del cami�n' has class 'ac:name="warning"'. When this happens, we need to use the following markdown format: Each text line must be preced by a '>' character, and a new line after the text must be inserted with notation '{.is-info}'. For example:

> Info text here
> Second line tex here
{.is-info}

Or:

> Warning text here
> Second line warrning here
{.is-warning}

Or: 

> Success text here
> Second line success here
{.is-success}
Or:
> error text here
> Second line error here
{.is-danger}

### Request 20 - July 28, 2025 - 21:48:12
Line breaks within a cell table are no parsed correctly. For example, this table at @confluence-karen-sample/entities.xml:10454 has '<p></p>' tags, but the output table at @confluence_pages_test/wiki/spaces/~5f455ab0e115420046c149c4/pages/2752905248.md does not have breack lines.

### Request 21 - July 28, 2025 - 21:55:31
When a table is created in markdown format, Can you always set the first column aligned to the left ?. So for example, instead of '|---|---|' it should be '|:---|---|'.

### Request 22 - July 28, 2025 - 22:34:23
For each markdown page we extract, we need to include the following metadata at the top of the page:

---
title: My Awesome Page
author: John Doe
description:
tags: [wiki, markdown, metadata]
date: 2025-07-28
---

Please replace the title with the each page title. Not sure if you can extract the page author, description, tags and date. If not, just extract the page title, so worst case will be:

### Request 23 - July 28, 2025 - 22:36:05
You need to update the extract script at @extract_confluence_pages_with_paths.sh please read @.CLAUDE.md for more info.

### Request 24 - July 28, 2025 - 22:59:40
Some confluence pages have a Roadmap planner image, which is build using this Confluence plugin: https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/roadmap-planner-macro-704578202.html When parsed, the extracted page @confluence-pages/wiki/spaces/~61b9de20028e300068a4d871/pages/1495662674.md only some strange characthers. Check this image: @2025-07-28_18-54.png Do you think there a way we can export this Roadmap planner image and insert it the output page as an image ? Please take a time to analyze or websearch.

### Request 25 - July 28, 2025 - 23:12:35
OK, thanks. Within the Confluence pages, we have some externals links to JIRA o MIRO. For example, this link 'https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/browse/SP-41" is somewhere at @confluence-ivan-sample/entities.xml probably as "SP-41", but when parsed and output is shows like this 'SP-41667208aa-9311-3993-9de0-1aa18660f265System Jira' in the output file @confluence-pages/wiki/spaces/~61b9de20028e300068a4d871/pages/2060484610.md:10 
The expected behaviour is that in the output file the parsed link must show as:
- [JIRA SP-41](https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/browse/SP-41)
{.links-list}

Some thing with other external links like this miro link: 'https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN2rCtpk=/'

### Request 26 - July 28, 2025 - 23:13:29
Search for BodyContent with ID containing references to page 2060484610 or search for "Historia" to find the body content that contains the JIRA link issue

### Request 27 - July 29, 2025 - 00:58:57
Within confluence, some pages can be "parent" pages with related "child" pages, which at the same time, can be "parent" page for more child pages. We need to output related childs pages when creating each *.md file when parsing the @confluence-ivan-sample/entities.xml file.
Please check, but, for example, the parent page ID: '2737176594' seems to have the child pages '2737209362, 2737668098, 2877227067, 2901442561, and more'. At the same time, page ID: '2737668098' seems to have child pages '2737471491, 2737799187, 2739798017, and more'. What we need is, for example, when creating output markdown for page 2737176594, place at the end of the file the following markdown block:
"
# Related Pages

> - [Child Page Title](link)
> - [Child Page Title](link)
> {.links-list}
<!-- {blockquote:.is-info} -->
"

### Request 28 - July 29, 2025 - 01:06:23
Nice job dude.

### Request 29 - July 29, 2025 - 13:44:00
Similar to the "Related Pages" block where we include a link to the child pages, please include in the header section (below the markdown metadata) of the *.md files a "Parent Page" block, that includes the Parent page (only if exitts).

### Request 30 - July 29, 2025 - 13:52:18
Please check why this attchment was not found ? @confluence-pages/wiki/spaces/SI/pages/2001141767.md:36

### Request 31 - July 29, 2025 - 14:00:28
Actual attachment output is "/attachments/2001141767/2028470294/SSO & Intranet System.pdf"  Can you change the attachment name to some standard without spaces ? (replace space for _)

### Request 32 - July 29, 2025 - 14:28:02
Can you check why on the generated page @confluence-pages/wiki/spaces/PAD/pages/2855501828.md the attachments where not exported

### Request 33 - July 30, 2025 - 19:00:56
I just executed the script @extract_confluence_pages_final.sh . Can you check why page ID 2120417305 was not generated ? It should have been created in this directory confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/PT/pages

### Request 34 - July 30, 2025 - 19:15:25
OK, but if you check the generated the child page @confluence-pages/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/2175042139.md you will notice that the parent page link is "/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/2120417305" page that does does not exist. Are you sure page ID 2120417305 is not the last version ? Because when reviewing directly in confluence the parent page 2120417305 do exist at the last version with name "Proyecto Mobile Planta".

### Request 35 - July 30, 2025 - 19:20:37
Ok, we need avoid skipping pages without substancial body content. So please fix the extraction script.

### Request 36 - July 30, 2025 - 19:22:09
Continue

### Request 37 - July 30, 2025 - 20:10:37
OK, thanks. Reviewing page @confluence_pages_test/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/2120417305.md why in the Related Pages the child page is 2175042139 is not present ? Please review and diagnose

### Request 38 - July 30, 2025 - 20:20:21
OK, one more request: Many confluence pages has links to JIRA issues. For example, this link https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/browse/GDPPO-1131 or this one https://tecnologiaeinnovacion.atlassian.net/browse/GDI-3099. Well, we need to change the link while keeping the issue ID. Replace the above links for https://proyectos.cic.cl/easy_tags/GDPPO-1131 and https://proyectos.cic.cl/easy_tags/GDI-3099

### Request 39 - July 30, 2025 - 21:30:51
OK, now one last request. I need to change some attachments names, otherwise they are not imported properly on the external system. For example, this attachment: @confluence_pages/attachments/2175042115/2175992410/tutorial_creaci�n_de_viajes_wms..docx  has a double dot ("."). Can you fix it so attachment name can be exported  as "tutorial_creacion_de_viajes_wms.docx" instead of "tutorial_creaci�n_de_viajes_wms..docx". I also replace the "�" for "o". Please also replace �, �, �, �, � and �, �, �, �, � for vocals without accent. Also replace atthchment characters such as ), [, ], (, &, /, \, !, #, $, %, =, {, } for "_". Thanks

### Request 40 - July 30, 2025 - 21:36:58
Now you can continue. I was extracting the last export for @entities.xml

### Request 41 - July 30, 2025 - 21:40:04
I delete all data...that's why you didn't find anything. I have just run "./extract_confluence_pages_final.sh entities.xml", so now you can search under @confluence_pages/

### Request 42 - July 30, 2025 - 21:41:45
Nice. Please updte @.CLAUDE.md for future reference.

### Request 43 - July 30, 2025 - 22:01:09
I have a doubt. The original confluence export @attachments directory weights 13GB. Then, we created the extraction @confluence_pages/attachments but this weights 4.8GB. So...it seems there are attachments that are not being migrated ?

### Request 44 - July 30, 2025 - 22:12:05
OK, thanks. Now, for now let's keep it as it is. But please write this information to the @.CLAUDE.md file.

### Request 45 - August 1, 2025 - 13:01:52
@.CLAUDE.md  Please check why some generated pages has some broken image links. For example page @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~61b9de20028e300068a4d871/pages/1937866774.md at line 31... the image "/attachments/1937866774/1937866799/5227448b-2f7d-4838-a19a-116fe2cba7de_media-blob-url_true_id_e957ff71-6451-4f11-a2b9-2c8deae73ac7_contextId_66326_collection_" is not found...maybe the name is too long ?

### Request 46 - August 1, 2025 - 13:09:47
The space before the closing ")", like "=x569" with width specification, is not an error. It was a feature request because the target application WikiJS allows this image logic markdown for resizing images. So, this is OK how it actually works.

### Request 47 - August 1, 2025 - 13:18:55
Thanks. It seems the broken link is because the image does not have and ending image extension like *.png or *.jpg . Do you think you can handle this kind of long strings images...and save them with some basic image name ?

### Request 48 - August 1, 2025 - 13:22:56
Also, can you check why the attachement "/attachments/2466086915/2473164803/1_Cambios_en_Rightnow.rar" at page @confluence_pages/wiki/spaces/~61b9de20028e300068a4d871/pages/2466086915.md was not copy (it does not exist) ?

### Request 49 - August 1, 2025 - 13:25:21
Great, thanks.

### Request 50 - August 1, 2025 - 18:12:45
Please write all the requests I did related to project on this file @claude-requested-text.md Just include the text I wrote for every request I asked. Thanks

### Request 51 - August 1, 2025 - 18:16:30
Please write all the requests I did related to project on this file @claude-requested-text.md Just include the text I wrote for every request I asked. You can get all the messages from this folder @/home/nmella/.claude/projects/-home-nmella-Projects-cic-wikijs-migration1
